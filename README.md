# alfred
Alfred is my personal script\backend to manage my house. Initially, it's to manage my book collection. At a later stage, it's going to be an interface to communicate with my POSTGRESQL database, to mine data with respect to my house, and to incorporate features specific to my household. Perhaps eventually, I will include methods to generalize it for others.
Note: Python2 for now.
