Alfred is my personal script\backend to manage my house. Initially, it's to manage my book collection. At a later stage, it's going to be an interface to communicate with my POSTGRESQL database, to mine data with respect to my house, and to incorporate features specific to my household. Perhaps eventually, I will include methods to generalize it for others.


# Features & Plans:

    * A Database to hold the information I'm going to be using here. Preferably using SQLLite or POSTGRESQL.
    * A Whatsapp Chat Bot to communicate with. It should be able to:
        - Respond to queries about the database.
        - Return Google search results.
        - Download and share manga as a PDF on a weekly basis (scheduled).
        - When sent a url, and a keyword, it should be able to convert to PDF or mobi.
        - When sent an image, it should download it and save it to a secure location.
        - Run off a Raspberry Pi 2 (or a cluster of Pi 3s)
    * A Reddit Bot to scrape information regarding books.
    * Amazon price scraper bot for my wishlist.
    * A script to track members of the house.
